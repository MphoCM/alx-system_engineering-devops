Any software system fails or crushes sometimes, and that failure can be caused by a wide range of possible factors like bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error. Failing is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve yourself.
Software Engineers must learn from their mistakes to make sure that they wonâ€™t happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not.



A postmortem refers to a retrospective analysis or examination conducted after the completion of a project, event, or process. The purpose of a postmortem is to review what went well, what went wrong, and what could be improved for future endeavors. It's a way for individuals or teams to learn from their experiences and identify areas for growth and optimization.

In a business or project management context, a postmortem typically involves discussing the project's goals, the strategies employed, challenges faced, and the outcomes achieved. This analysis can help identify successes and failures, allowing for better decision-making and improvement in future projects.
